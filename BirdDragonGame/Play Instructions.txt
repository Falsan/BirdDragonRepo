To angle the bird, point the mouse in a direction and click with the left mouse button. The bird will spin towards that direction.

Known bugs with this system is the inability for the bird to point directly downwards or upwards. This is an issue with quarternion rotation i believe which i have been unable to solve in the time limit.

Flight, controller controls

To accelerate, simply hit right bumper repeatedly on an xbox controller. To decelerate, simply hit left bumper repeatedly.

Should you wish to reverse, hit left bumper repeatedly.

To angle the bird, twist the left analogue stick in a direction. A helpful directional indicator is on the front of the bird to assist you with turning.

Turning harshly in certain directions can lead to issues with the control system, so gentle turns and movements are advised.
